# Green Route

GreenRoute is designed to promote sustainable transportation by connecting individuals traveling in the same direction, allowing them to share rides. This approach not only reduces commuting costs but also minimizes environmental impact and fosters community connections.



## Features

### Carpooling
- Connect with colleagues and neighbors for shared rides
- Find or offer rides based on your commute route
- Reduce carbon emissions by sharing vehicles
- Track your environmental impact over time

### Environmental Impact

GreenRoute helps reduce carbon emissions in two key ways:

1. **Carpooling**: Each shared ride can reduce carbon emissions by up to 1kg CO2 per km compared to individual trips.
2. **Smart Parking**: Reducing time spent searching for parking decreases fuel consumption and emissions.
## Tech Stack
